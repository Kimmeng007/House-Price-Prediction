# House-Price-Prediction
This project was created for the [**Kaggle Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/home-data-for-ml-course) competition.   The goal is to **predict the final sale price of residential homes** using various machine learning regression models. We achieved a top 1% ranking (56th out of 6,980 participants) in this kaggle competition on 13th March 2025.

- Performed **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand the dataset.  
- Built and compared multiple regression models:
  - Linear Regression  
  - Ridge, Lasso & ElasticNet Regression
  - Support Vector Regression
  - Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost  
- Used **cross-validation** and **hyperparameter tuning** to improve performance.
